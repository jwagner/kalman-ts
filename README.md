# kalman-ts

A simplistic library for implementing kalman filters written in typescript, using ml-matrix for matrix operations.

I've written this library for my own projects so it's not really polished, optimized or feature complete.

Still needs documentation. See [index.test.ts](index.test.ts) for usage.
